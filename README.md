ShapeAI-Cyber-Security:

This is the project from Day 7 of the Python and Cyber Security Bootcamp conducted by Shape AI.

On running 'weather.py' it ask for an input that is a city name.
Please do not enter cities whose names are multiple words (eg. New Delhi, New York, Rio de Janeiro).

On entering a city name, the program outputs the weather information of that city at that particular time.
It also saves a file on your device with the same weather information.
Since it saves a file on your device... os, sys, stat libraries must be installed and necessary access should be provided.

Harsh *Bro*, if you're reading this... It was a pleasure to have a mentor like you and the bootcamp was truly a wonderful experience!
