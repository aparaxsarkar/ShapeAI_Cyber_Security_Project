This is the project from Day 7 of the Python and Cyber Security Bootcamp conducted by Shape AI.

On running 'weather.py' it asks for an input that is a city name.
On entering a city name, the program prints the weather information of that city at that particular time.
It also saves a file on your device with the same weather information.
